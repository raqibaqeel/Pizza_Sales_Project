## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze key indicators for pizza sales data to gain insights into business performance. Specifically, my aim to calculate the following metrics:

### Key Metrics:

**Total Revenue**: Sum of the total price of all pizza orders.
**Average Order Value:** Average amount spent per order, calculated by dividing total revenue by total number of orders.
**Total Pizzas Sold:** Sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.
**Total Orders:** Total number of orders placed.
**Average Pizzas Per Order:** Average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing total number of pizzas sold by total number of orders.

## Visualization Requirements
To gain comprehensive insights into our pizza sales data, I've crafted specific visualization requirements.
